                I am Mazi Prima Reza, currently working from home as a data scientist at Vidio. With the team, I am building recommendation system using any kind of methods that might work, but most of the time, it is machine learning. As a data scientist, I am responsible for end-to-end development, from EDA to deployment (with the help of software engineer) and monitoring.<br><br>
                My journey in obsessing machine learning and data science is a long story to tell, but in brief, it started when I took a Deep Learning class in my last semester at Institut Teknologi Bandung. I was passionate for computational math and realizing that machine learning is somewhat part of it was amazed me. Since then, I was eager to learn more about data science until I become one.<br><br>
                I'll update this page soon and write down my skills and what I can do in the professional field.
