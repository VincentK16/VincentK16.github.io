<h3>Hi!</h3>

<p>
    Starting from Tumblr.com in 2013, I was a young girl who found joy in customizing my Tumblr blog interface. Every day, after school, I would rush home, open my laptop, and dive into the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I surf the web for Tumblr tutorials and eagerly experimented with different layouts. This daily ritual sparked my passion for web development and taught me the fundamentals of coding.

    Fast forward to today, and that same passion has guided me in building this portfolio website. Despite the evolution of front-end frameworks, I cherish the nostalgia of using the same techniques and languages that captivated my 13-year-old self.

    Back to 17, where I began planning for university that I realized my hobby could transform into a career. My heart was set on joining the Computer Science related majors. However, insecurities held me back, and I decided to pursue a degree in Mathematics at ITB instead.

    Yet, the desire to involve myself in technology never diminished. I continue my journey and discovered a love for data science and artificial intelligence. This path has led me to become a Data Scientist and AI Engineer, fulfilling my dream of being a tech woman.
